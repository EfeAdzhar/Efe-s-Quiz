## My Quiz App
#### Hello there, this is my first serious app. This quiz app will contain Historical, Political, and many other interesting quizzes. 
#### I love taking quizzes in my free time, so I've thought that it would be a great idea to create my quiz app and also explain how it works so that you can do the same if you wanna) 
### Main menu
#### Main menu is the easiest part, all you need to do is to create a `UILabel` with some text using `label.text` command. And also a `Sign In` button using `UIButton`. 
#### To switch on `Registration Page` we need to create a function that allows us to switch on it after pressing a button. Easy, just create a function, and use the `show` command. After that, we need to `addTarget` to our button in our `viewDidLoad` so that it will work when the view loads. 
### By the way, I'm using `Navigation Controller` in Storyboard to make things more beautiful and smooth. And also use some `CAGradientLayer` to make buttons and views more pleasant for my eyes.

#### Here's what `ViewController` or welcome screen looks like:

## Long time no see God Damit! 
#### Managed to UITableView to do some work and now I have a list of my tests! HURAAYY!
#### Now the only thing that left is to guess how to make one ViewController for all test so I don't have to create 10 ViewControllers for 10 tests. 
#### As i said I'm writing this on my own and just looking for Documentation or videos if I don't know anything about the UI Element. 
#### I found this great method "register(class:)" so i made cell programmatically without Storyboard which makes me proud of myself. Even though I stole it from Stack Overflow, I study it and I now know how It works. 

### ANN OF CORSE!
#### The hardest part is now is to make a QUIZ!! SUPRICE!
#### I have absolutley no idea how i will do it. But at least I will try on my own and then watch some videos of how people have made it so I can understand where I can make it better.
