## My Quiz App
#### Hello there, this is my first serious app. This quiz app will contain Historical, Political, and many other interesting quizzes. 
#### I love taking quizzes in my free time, so I've thought that it would be a great idea to create my quiz app and also explain how it works so that you can do the same if you wanna) 
### Main menu
#### Main menu is the easiest part, all you need to do is to create a `UILabel` with some text using `label.text` command. And also a `Sign In` button using `UIButton`. 
#### To switch on `Registration Page` we need to create a function that allows us to switch on it after pressing a button. Easy, just create a function, and use the `show` command. After that, we need to `addTarget` to our button in our `viewDidLoad` so that it will work when the view loads. 
### By the way, I'm using `Navigation Controller` in Storyboard to make things more beautiful and smooth. And also use some `CAGradientLayer` to make buttons and views more pleasant for my eyes.

#### Here's what `ViewController` or welcome screen looks like:
